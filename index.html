        <h3>Rank1: Wednesday Season1</h3>
        <p>I like Wednesday Season 1 because it is dark, funny, and interesting. The main character is smart and brave, and I enjoy her calm personality. The story has many mysteries, so I always want to know what happens next. The school setting is unique, and the music and visuals look cool. It is easy to follow but still exciting, which makes it fun to watch after a long study day.</p>
        <h3>Rank2: Squid Game Season1</h3>
        <p>I like Squid Game Season 1 because it is very exciting and emotional. The games are simple but dangerous, so the story keeps me focused all the time. It also shows strong messages about money and hard life, which feels realistic. The characters are easy to understand, and I feel sympathy for them. It is intense but meaningful, so it is a good show to watch when I want a break from studying and trading.</p>
        <h3>Rank3: Zootopia2</h3>
        <p>I like Zootopia 2 because it looks fun, colorful, and full of adventure. The characters are friendly and brave, and the story teaches good lessons about teamwork and understanding others. The animation is beautiful and easy to enjoy. It feels relaxing and positive, so it is a nice movie to watch after studying at night or during your free time on the weekend.</p>
